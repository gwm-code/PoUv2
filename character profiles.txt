⚜️ Character Profiles — “Mistheart Spire”
1. Eyla, the River Elf Healer

Race/Class: River Elf • Healer
Age: 124 (appears 23)
Alignment: Neutral Good
Weapon: Spirit Staff of Willowlight
Special Trait: “Mist Purge” — Cleanses possession once per battle.

Backstory:
Eyla once served as a priestess in the tranquil marsh temples of Lirien Vale. Her healing magic was unmatched until the day her younger sister, Nael, was taken by the Mist while Eyla searched for herbs. Her healing failed—her faith broke. Wracked with guilt, she now journeys toward Mistheart Spire, believing that destroying the source may finally redeem her.
Whispers claim she experiments with forbidden “reversal rites,” trying to undo death itself—a hint of the dangerous obsession that might make her the Arch-Mage’s successor… or the Arch-Mage herself.

Personality:
Compassionate, melancholy, and self-sacrificing. Eyla hides her grief behind calm composure but often risks herself for others.

Appearance:
Tall, slender, and graceful, with silver-white hair braided with river reeds. Her eyes shimmer a pale aquamarine that glows faintly when she channels magic. She wears a tattered healer’s robe of faded teal silk and carries a willowwood staff capped with a shard of crystal that hums softly in misty air.

2. Greyor, the Fallen Paladin

Race/Class: Human • Paladin Tank
Age: 46
Alignment: Lawful Neutral
Weapon: Greatshield “Vowbreaker” and Bastard Sword
Special Trait: “Unyielding Faith” — Becomes immune to fear or charm.

Backstory:
Once Captain of the Dawn Guard, Greyor commanded a holy battalion defending the Ironpeak border. When the Mist descended, his men succumbed to madness and turned on each other. Unable to stop them, he fled—a shame he has never forgiven himself for. He believes order and discipline are mankind’s only salvation. Some whisper his obsession with purging corruption might drive him to extremes, even if it means cleansing the world itself.

Personality:
Disciplined, stoic, and unrelenting. Speaks like a soldier giving orders even in casual talk. His faith is absolute but brittle.

Appearance:
Broad-shouldered and scarred, with a greying beard and pale blue eyes like ice on steel. His once-polished armor is dulled and dented, etched with old scripture now half-worn away. A tattered white tabard hangs over the mail, marked by the sun emblem of his fallen order.

3. Shawath, the Rogue Assassin

Race/Class: Human • Rogue
Age: 31
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
Weapon: Twin daggers “Debt” and “Due”
Special Trait: “Fade Step” — Dodge first fatal blow each battle.

Backstory:
A smuggler, thief, and killer-for-hire from the city of Roenmar, Shawath lived for profit and pleasure. When the Mist choked the trade routes, his riches vanished overnight. He joined the heroes not out of duty, but because their mission promised survival and loot. Yet beneath his mocking humor, Shawath hides knowledge of secret dealings with alchemists who may have first spread the Mist… knowledge worth killing—or dying—for.

Personality:
Cynical, witty, and dangerously charming. Always has a backup plan (and a hidden blade). Trusts no one completely.

Appearance:
Lean and agile, with raven-black hair tied back, olive skin, and eyes sharp as cut obsidian. Wears a dark leather cloak lined with throwing knives and a half-mask he raises only when fighting—smirking beneath it.

4. Fynrey, the Ancient Mage

Race/Class: Elf • Mage
Age: ~600+ (uncertain)
Alignment: True Neutral
Weapon: Arcane Tome “Chronicle of Ashes”
Special Trait: “Echo of Ages” — Recasts last spell for free once per battle.

Backstory:
Fynrey remembers the first age of kingdoms—before the Mist. He believes it’s not a curse but a forgotten relic of primal magic designed to cleanse the world of decay. His motives blur between preservation and destruction. Rumors say he once served the Arch-Mage himself centuries ago, and that his survival is sustained through soulbinding—anchoring fragments of his essence in the Mist.

Personality:
Calm, cryptic, and otherworldly. Speaks in riddles. Sees time as circular and inevitability as truth.

Appearance:
Pale skin like candle wax, long silver hair cascading over dark violet robes embroidered with constellations. His pupils shimmer like stars when casting spells. Always surrounded by faint drifting motes of ash that never fall.

5. Gilla, the Alchemist Specialist

Race/Class: Human • Alchemist
Age: 28
Alignment: Neutral Good
Weapon: Vial-thrower Gauntlet and portable satchel-lab
Special Trait: “Catalyst Surge” — Doubles potion effect for one use.

Backstory:
Born in the Scholar’s District of the ruined city Aldenroot, Gilla sought to study the Mist as a phenomenon, not a plague. One experiment went wrong—her prototype containment mist spread through the lab, overtaking her mentor. The ensuing fire left her scarred and guilt-ridden. She now travels to Mistheart Spire to undo what she helped unleash, torn between scientific obsession and moral despair.

Personality:
Brilliant, fast-talking, and awkward. Uses humor to mask fear. Keeps meticulous notes on every mutation or reaction.

Appearance:
Freckled, with copper hair tied messily under goggles often streaked with soot. Wears a reinforced alchemist’s coat patched with burn marks and pockets full of clinking bottles. Her right hand bears faint chemical scars, always gloved.

6. Zakarath, the Shapeshifter Exile

Race/Class: Shapeshifter (last of his kind)
Age: Unknown (appears 35)
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
Weapon: Morphing Claws / Natural weapons
Special Trait: “Formshift” — Adapts resistance to last damage type received.

Backstory:
Hunted and branded a monster for his ability to assume other forms, Zakarath was cast out decades ago. He retreated to the Ironpeak wilds, living as beast and man until the Mist poisoned even the wilderness. Now he follows the heroes, not for redemption but to destroy what threatens his solitude. Yet some believe he envies the Mist—it remakes the world just as he can remake himself.

Personality:
Quiet, animalistic, sardonic. Values freedom over morality. Loyalty must be earned, never demanded.

Appearance:
Rugged and feral, with copper-bronze skin that flickers with faint shifting patterns. His eyes are amber with vertical pupils. When angered, his features ripple, briefly revealing claws or fur beneath his human guise. Usually cloaked in rough hides and bone charms.

7. Kroge, the Fallen Ranger-Knight

Race/Class: Human • Ranger / Knight hybrid
Age: 39
Alignment: Lawful Good → Neutral (after exile)
Weapon: Longbow “Widowmaker” & Ranger’s Sabre
Special Trait: “Oath of Ashes” — Increases damage when below 50% HP.

Backstory:
Once a royal ranger-knight sworn to the crown, Kroge defied the king’s decree to execute his infected wife and child. Branded a traitor, he was stripped of title and exiled. He roams the lands with haunted eyes, seeking either vengeance or forgiveness. To him, the Mist is not just death—it is judgment for the sins of men. Perhaps he seeks to end it… or to let it finish what it started.

Personality:
Honorable yet tormented. Rarely smiles. Speaks plainly, acts decisively. Haunted by recurring dreams of his family calling him from the fog.

Appearance:
Tall and muscular, with tangled dark hair streaked in grey. His armor is a patchwork of ranger leathers and knight’s plate, worn and scorched. A silver locket with miniature portraits hangs around his neck. His eyes, one blue and one brown, are always scanning the horizon.
