# Mistheart Spire – Core Premise

## High-Level Hook
- **Genre:** 16-bit-inspired 2D RPG (FF6 / Chrono Trigger pacing)
- **Tone Mix:** Dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic survival, political intrigue (GoT × TLoU)
- **Crisis:** A grey Mist rolls out of the Ironpeak range. Anything it touches becomes a mind-controlled husk.
- **Objective:** Escort seven heroes to the Mistheart Spire to sever the source.
- **Twist:** One of those seven is secretly the Arch-Mage who authored the plague: “I wrote the plague. And I’m not finished.”

## Player Character
- **Origin:** “18 years a slave” – player names the protagonist.
- **Lifetime Class (permanent pick):**
  - *Blacksmith Slave* – unlocks “Create” at forges; crafts Mythic gear.
  - *Alchemist Slave* – brews combat/alchemy items, including temporary class transformations.
  - *Hunter Slave* – harvests monster materials; unlocks bounty contracts.
- Class choice affects crafting menus, dialogue options (“Title” prompts), side quests, and late-game economy.

## The Seven Heroes (3 active in battle)
| Hero | Role | Motive Seeds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Eyla** | River Elf Healer | Failed to save her sister; desperate, radical cure attempts. |
| **Greyor** | Paladin Tank | Abandoned battalion; craves strict order/redemption. |
| **Shawath** | Rogue Assassin | Mercenary pragmatist chasing wealth/power. |
| **Fynrey** | Ancient Mage | Believes Mist is ancient magic; might weaponize it. |
| **Gilla** | Alchemist | Caused a lab disaster; guilt-driven to “fix” it. |
| **Zakarath** | Shapeshifter | Exiled; tempted to cleanse civilization. |
| **Kroge** | Fallen Ranger-Knight | Lost family to royal decree; revenge vs. authority. |

One hero is the traitor Arch-Mage; identity revealed at the Spire climax.

## Combat Pillars
- **Active Time Battle:** ATB gauges fill via Agility; turns resolve when full.
- **Possession Status:** Mist afflictions hijack heroes (skipped turns or forced ally attacks). Counterplay via cures, dispels, or aggressive pacing.
- **XP Flow:** Individual XP bars, bonus XP for finishing blows, quest XP assignable by the player.
- **Traits:** Level-ups present two semi-random trait choices (3-turn buffs, once per battle) to customize builds.

## Progression & Systems
- **Stats:** Strength, Agility, Endurance, Mana. Derived combat skills (Parry, Crit, Resist, etc.) unlock through gear/traits.
- **Crafting & Gear:** Rarities from Common → Mythic with affixes. High-tier crafting demands rare boss items + everyday mats so the full map stays relevant.
- **Meta Progression:** After a few clears, a shared vault unlocks to stash gear/gold between runs (roguelite flavor).

## World & Replayability
- **Procedural Generation:** New game → regenerate world map, biome placement, town/dungeon layouts, and even shop inventories.
- **Structure Targets:** 6 biomes, 12 towns, 18 dungeons, 1 final Spire per run.
- **Encounter Rhythm:** Random battles every 2–20 steps, influenced by biome and danger level.

## Endings
1. **Execute the Traitor:** Mist ends; afflicted die. Bitter victory.
2. **Forgive the Traitor:** Mist rewrites into a cure; world saved.
